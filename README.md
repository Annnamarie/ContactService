CS 320 Software Testing - JUnit Testing

***How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?***

In order to ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I can put my code into several types of test. Here in this project, we used Junit tests to ensure that all requirements are incorporated and working as intended. There are many other tests that can be used an they all serve a different purpose. Some of these test are integration test, regression test, functional test, user acceptance test, etc.

***How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into the program?***

It is important to determine what the user needs are. These can be identified by doing interviews, surveys, or if the client provides this. These will be the requirements that needs to be incorporated into program. For instance in this project, there were several requirements such as that contactID cannot be null and cannot be longer than 10 char.

***How do I approach designing software?***

To approach software design, we need to understand user needs. Then these requirements are incorporated into the program and a unit test can be made to verify that it is working and behaving as intended.
